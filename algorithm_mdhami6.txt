Main Program
The purpose of this program is to take the date YYYYMMDD in a variety of different formats and return the date in MMM DD, YYYY. 
First the program will have to be cleaned up and remove any extra characters, then pass through a few checking scripts to confirm that the date is an acceptable input. 
After it is cross referenced to make sure each part of the date falls under a correct range and then confirms whether or not it is a leap year. 
After everything has been checked and confirmed as either True of False the program will commence taking the acceptable input and converting it to the newly formatted date. 
We then print the formatted date for the user. 

leap_year() The function will take in the year input from sanitize() and cross check with its table. 
If the year falls under a lear year the function will return True, otherwise will return false.

range_check() The function will take the entire date from sanitize and will check to see if the dates for each YYYY, MM and DD fall inside of the range, 
for example there can be no thirteenth month, or thirty-second day.

sanitize() The function will take the date input from the user and remove any extra character delimiters, such as '.', '/' or '-'. 
Once all extra characters have been removed the function returns the new date.

size_check() The function will compare the size of the inputted date with the size expected for the integer value, 
such as year, month or day and return either True if the input is correct, or False if the input is incorrect.

usage() The function will take any other function name as an input and return a string describing exactly what the function that was called does.
